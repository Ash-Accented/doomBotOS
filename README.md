# doomBotOS
## An earnest attempt at programming a discord bot, capable of running doom live in a text-channel.
### PS: Also does other things I required for utility, like simple music commands for personal reasons.


```
//CURRENT SLASH COMMANDS - (Arguments are enclosed in square brackets)
/bash_command [string_args] //Executes a bash_command on a virtual machine in docker running alpine:v3.23 (where the bot currently runs), was thinking to modify this to execute the command from the host machine, and return the standard output of the virtual machine.
/ping //Delivers the messaging ping of the bot



(REQUIRES HOSTING A UNIQUE BOT, RUNNING CODE CLONED FROM MY GITHUB, ON YOUR MACHINE)
/play_local_directory [local_directory_string] //Plays the mp3, wav, or flac files in a local directory of choice, as if it were a playlist
/play_local_audio_file [local_file_path_string]
```
